 * Who is allowed to do what inside a room.

 * playback actions from anyone but the host. It does not know about the finer
 * one: in [ControlModes.EVERYONE] a track belongs to whoever queued it, and only
 * that person or the host may skip past it. That rule lives here, on the client,
 * and is advisory — it decides what the UI offers, not what the server accepts.
 * A modified client could still send the action; the point is that the ordinary
 * one presents an honest interface rather than buttons that silently fail.
 *
 * Pure functions on purpose: this is the logic that decides whether a control is
 * greyed out, and it is much easier to be sure of when it can be tested directly.
