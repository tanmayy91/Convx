/**
 * The DJ filter: one low-pass and one high-pass per channel, with cutoffs that
 * glide toward a target instead of jumping.
 *
 * Separate from `CustomEqualizerAudioProcessor` on purpose, for two reasons.
 * That one calls `filters.forEach { it.reset() }` on every `applyProfile()`, so
 * driving it a few times a second during a transition would zero the filter
 * state and click each time; and it holds the user's own EQ profile, which a
 * transition has no business overwriting.
 *
 * Idle state is fully open (low-pass at Nyquist, high-pass at DC), where this
 * is a straight buffer copy — which is where every player sits when DJ mixing
 * is off.
