/**
 * Direct-form-1 biquad, low-pass and high-pass only (RBJ cookbook).
 *
 * Separate from `eq/audio/BiquadFilter.kt`, which implements the peaking and
 * shelving types the parametric EQ needs and has no low/high-pass at all, and
 * whose constructor fixes the frequency for the filter's lifetime. Here the
 * cutoff moves while audio flows, so coefficients are recomputed in place and
 * the state variables are deliberately never cleared — that is exactly what
 * stops a moving filter from clicking.
