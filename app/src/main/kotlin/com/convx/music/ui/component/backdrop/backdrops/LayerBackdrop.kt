 * Vendored so the library ships as source with this app (binary AARs compiled
 * against older Compose broke at runtime) and to add a backdrop resolution
 * scale for cheaper effect rendering. KMP expect/actual declarations were
 * merged into this single Android source set. Package renamed accordingly.

     * Deliberately a plain field, NOT snapshot state. It is written during the

     * as snapshot state that read registered a draw dependency, so the write at
     * the end of each frame invalidated every surface, which dirtied the root
     * layer, which re-ran this node's draw and bumped the counter again. That
     * loop redrew the whole app at the GPU's maximum rate forever, on every
     * screen, with nothing on screen moving — measured 394 draws in 5s on a
     * static settings list, with no recomposition, measure or layout in the
     * trace. Freshness does not depend on the invalidation: a surface's recorded
     * layer replays this backdrop's RenderNode by reference, so re-recording the
     * source is picked up without the surface re-recording anything.
