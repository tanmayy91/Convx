        // frame time was 89ms median with measure+layout at 0.03ms and the GPU at
        // 4ms, i.e. essentially all of it in display-list recording — 38.6ms
        // median, 42.9ms p90. Recording cost scales with the number of draw ops in
        // the tree, not with pixels, so the second traversal was close to a

        // equivalent to having drawn the tree directly.

        // every child RenderNode that did not change; layer.record { drawContent() }
