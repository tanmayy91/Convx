/**
 * A bottom-bar / side-bar destination.
 *
 * One icon per destination per UI style — deliberately not a selected/unselected
 * pair. iOS ships outline/filled pairs because its tab bar has no selection
 * indicator; this bar has both a glass puck and an accent content colour, so a
 * filled variant would be a third signal saying the same thing. Two artworks per
 * tab also have to be optically aligned against each other or the icon visibly
 * shifts on selection, which is exactly the cheap-looking wobble the pair would
 * have bought us.
