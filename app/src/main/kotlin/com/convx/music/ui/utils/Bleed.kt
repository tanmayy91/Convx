/**
 * Lets a horizontally scrolling row escape its parent's start padding and run
 * under the floating side bar.
 *
 * The vertical list keeps its start content padding, so rows stay clear of the
 * panel. A carousel inside that list would inherit the same offset and stop dead
 * at the panel's edge — nothing is ever drawn beneath it, so the glass has
 * nothing to blur and the cards look cut off rather than tucked under.
 *
 * This measures the child [inset] wider than the slot and places it that far to
 * the left, while still reporting the slot's original width so the list's own
 * layout is untouched. Pair it with [plusStart] on the carousel's own
 * contentPadding so its FIRST card still starts clear of the panel and only the
 * ones you scroll past travel underneath.
 *
 * Start-edge only: the offset is applied on the physical left, matching the side
 * bar, which is itself pinned to the left rather than to the layout direction.
