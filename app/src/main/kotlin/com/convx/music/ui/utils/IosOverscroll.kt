 * mutated synchronously in [applyToScroll] — not an
 * [androidx.compose.animation.core.Animatable] — because `applyToScroll` isn't
 * suspend and every scroll delta during a drag used to launch its own
 * fire-and-forget `snapTo` coroutine. Under a fast drag that's dozens of coroutines
 * racing each other per second, and the offset could end up stuck on a stale value
 * from a coroutine that hadn't run yet. A coroutine (and a real spring) is only
 * needed once, on release, to animate back to rest.
