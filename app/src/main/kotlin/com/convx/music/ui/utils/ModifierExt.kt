/*
 * The two click modifiers below used to add a spring scale-down on press. That is
 * gone. It was built on `composed {}`, which the Compose compiler cannot skip and
 * which defeats modifier reuse, and each instance additionally allocated a
 * MutableInteractionSource, started a collectIsPressedAsState flow collector,
 * started an animateFloatAsState, and added a graphicsLayer — per item, rebuilt
 * every time a row recycled. With ~200 call sites, nearly all of them inside lazy
 * lists, that was the app's largest per-frame scroll cost. The reference app this
 * one is compared against uses plain combinedClickable and has no `composed {}`
 * anywhere.
 *
 * These stay as named wrappers rather than being deleted so the ~200 call sites,
 * and the option of reintroducing the press feedback, both stay in one place. To
 * bring the bounce back, implement it as a Modifier.Node — not with `composed`.
